        Welcome to my playground! I'm Torben Stolt - a product designer who is looking to push
        creative boundaries and create functional yet fun internaction to humanize technology. I
        have a background of working hands-on in the Fashion e-commerce scene with references from
        Henrik Vibskov and Showstudio/Machine-A. Most recently I discovered my love for big data at
        the tech startup Fashion Cloud. I'm currently finalising the Ironhack UX/UI Design bootcamp.

      <p>
        Below you can find an outline of my creative process which helps me to deliver
        user-centered, goal-driven designs.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Identify & Clarify</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most essential parts in the process if identifying and defining all aspects
            of the project goals, audience market, competitors, specifications and requirements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Discover & Strategize</h3>
          <p>
            My goal with each project is to deliver solid and real-world solutions that achieve
            actual business needs, we do this through idea generation and exploration which parts
            make sense.

        <li>
          <h3>Designing An Experience</h3>
          <p>
            The creative part of the process where we take everything we learned and use it to
            direct a solution-based design approach that aims to solve the issues and achieve our
            set goals
