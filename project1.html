        <p class="paragraphs">Redesign of an app. The only constraints, it must be a well-known native mobile app and the new design should challenge the existing information architecture. The challenge was completed in 2 weeks.
          Vinted is an online marketplace where users can sell, buy or swap second-hand clothing. The marketplace can be accessed through a desktop website and a mobile app. With a community of close to 65 million active users, the platform offers an immensely broad product assortment which can be seen as its core value.
          In the following, I will explore measures to make the assortment better accessible to users and solutions to guide users along their user flow.</p>
        <p class="paragraphs">A heuristic analysis forms the basis of the research process. The homepage scores significantly low in this analysis because it fails to enable users to complete 2 main tasks.
          The homepage fails at directing users to product groups of their interest.
          The current layout is built essentially product-centric. The layout therefore fails at encouraging users to discover product themes such as categories or brands. 
          The page features a section with the title 'My Feed'. The section displays a seemingly unrelated mix of products grouped together. Users have no indication how and why products appear in their feed.
          The homepage fails at inspiring users to discover new brands.
          The page features a section that aims at helping users to discover new brands. The sections includes a series of buttons with brand names that link directly to the product overview pages. However, the buttons are not grouped following an obvious logic (e.g.), they are missing clear indication of calls to action and lack visibility in size and color.
          The page also features an overview of popular search keywords. This feature also aims at encouraging users to discover product themes. However, the title of the section 'Search suggestions' is not descriptive and the buttons are shown in random order, unrelated to the search volume. The content is therefore lacking context and becomes less meaningful.
          The homepage fails at providing a clear snapshot of content functionality, and proofs to be ineffective at directing users to their desired tasks.</p>
          <p class="paragraphs">ONBOARDING PROCESS
            The app offers users the option to customise their experience by completing a three step oboarding process. Below I have gathered an in-depth look at the usability challenges within this process.
            Step 1: Selecting sizes
            As an initial step the user has to select their sizes. To some users it may appear problematic that they have to select a binar gender option to proceed to the size overview. The size overview page is not formatted for usability and displays a long list of size options.
            Step 2: Selecting brands
            Secondly users select their favorite brands. The page displays a long list of brand names that are not sorted by any logic nor alphabetically. It is not possible to filter the list by genres or segments. The search bar does not provide suggestions or an auto-fill out option.
            Step 3: Selecting user profiles 
            Finally users select profiles of other users to follow. The page does not include any functionality and solely displays a written note that tells users to navigate directly to user profiles they want to follow. No further guidance is given.</p>
